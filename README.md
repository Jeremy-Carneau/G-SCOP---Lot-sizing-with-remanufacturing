# Objectives

We need to begin to analyze the uncapacitated lot sizing problem with and without dispose cases first (dispose = we can discard/sell stock of return ; treat both cases when this discard is a profit or a loss).


When finished, we can start including capacity (start without dispose first).


Take care of including holding costs increasing with the quality of the products ($h_t^r <= h_t^s <= h_t^n$)

# To do list

## Programming section

- [ ] Automate generation of flow graphs from linear program (LP) resolution (see if it is possible with Python or something, otherwise use LateX with tikz)

## Test section

- [ ] Generate different tests (variation of costs, ...) with at least 30 periods

## Mathematical section

- [ ] Find solution properties about the problem with and without dispose
